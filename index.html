		<p>As of the 1st of September 2023 I have recently begun my career as an IT Apprentice at The Quill Church of England Trust. As an IT apprentice, I find that learning in a more on-hands environment is more suited to my learning method as well as learning the theory side that is necessary to achieving the relevant qualifications I will need to progress in the future..</p>
                <p>I have an in-depth knowledge of both computer hardware and software, as well as good knowledge and understanding of Active Directory/Group Policy, DHCP, DNS, Windows Operating Systems, Exchange Email/Outlook, Anti-Virus, Network Cabling/Patching, Helpdesk Experience, File permissions and shares, PC hardware and peripherals such as scanners, USB readers or webcams and Microsoft 365. I also have an understanding of Apple Mobile Device Management (MDM) systems operating for both Apple and Android devices.</p>
                <p>In addition to my technical skills, I possess personal skills and attributes that are essential in the IT and Network Administration industry, including the ability to work on my own initiative, plan, organise and determine priorities. I have excellent organisational skills with good attention to detail. During a project in which I was involved in preparing a new computer suite and deployment of laptops, I had to ensure that the asset list comprising of several pieces of information about devices, was collected with a high level of accuracy, this included, the make, model, MAC Address, intended Computer Account name before I began the image stage of the project. The asset registrations had to take place within 1 working day allowing for the project to move forward as planned. This proactive work ensured that the imaging of devices was smooth, allowing for a successful deployment and enhancing the learning in several departments in the academy.</p>

                <p>Start Date: September 2023</p>
                <p>Job Title: IT Apprentice</p>
                <p>Description of Duties: I have just recently joined the Multi Academy Trust and have already been able to successfully contribute to many of the projects that had been in-progress and waiting for deployment and testing. One of the projects that I managed was printing on staff designated iPads. With the summer rollout of one-to-one staff and student iPads within the MAT schools, staff were extremely keen to see the arrival of air print added to their iPads. After doing more research into airprint and how to make it work with our current local services such as Papercut MF, I soon discovered that Papercut Mobility Print would be the best solution to deploying and managing printers on staff designated iPads. With managing credits a priority and a necessity, on our print server, I ran the installer for Papercut Mobility Print and on the site server that we had setup at Site A, I soon got the service up and running and with a few days iPad printing was setup and ready for light testing by myself and my colleagues, and after testing was successful, I drafted an all staff email that would be sent to both schools in the trust, I then deployed it out to all staff iPads and people soon started to print and appreciated that it gave them the option to utilise their iPad for their everyday needs especially for SEN children who needed to have access to resources where a TA would be out and about with the child and needs quick access to print and with iPads being rolled out this has allowed staff to really make the most of their device.</p>

                <p>Description of Duties: My role at ZTF Media was founder and CEO. I started the organisation 
in difficult times to help businesses across my local area and throughout the whole of the 
United Kingdom by installing services such as Office 365 (Microsoft 365) and an e-commerce 
website that enabled small business owners to resume normal operations but through online 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I resigned and stopped operations in August of 2022 due to a 
family crisis and my GCSES were shortly approaching. In my offices I had installed and 
maintained 6 local physcial servers with an Active Directory network, SCCM for imaging and 
application deployment, DHCP, 3CX for VOIP Calling, Group Policy with various security and 
management policies in place to manage the local computers on the network. I also installed 
the CAT 5E and CAT 6 wiring throughout the offices, using the correct tools for the job, I 
used the wallplates and patch panels, labelled the ports to identify each ethernet wall-plate.</p></p>
